## Experience
### Principal Research Scientist I (May 2022 – Present)  
**Information Technology and Systems Center, The University of Alabama in Huntsville**, Huntsville, AL

- **NASA Cloud-based Analytical Framework for Precipitation**  
    In collaboration with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA/MSFC), the focus of this project is to develop an application that involves software development and machine learning model development to enhance the resolution of GPM data for improved identification of convective scale precipitation features, particularly outside the range of ground-based weather radar. This resolution enhancement technology is called super-resolution or downscaling.

- **Sally Ride EarthKAM**  
Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students is a NASA educational outreach program that enables students, teachers, and the public to learn about Earth from the unique perspective of space. Students sign up for missions and request images; then, the International Space Station captures the images for the students.

- **NASA Earth Observations for Health (NEOH)**  
  The NEOH project is striving to improve malaria control decision-making in sub-Saharan Africa by developing and deploying technology for incorporating the latest NASA Earth observations for surface temperatures, precipitation, and vegetation health into the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) used worldwide, including all sub- Saharan African countries.
